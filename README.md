## 📄 Overview

The repository includes estimated intercepts and coefficients for occupant-driven window-opening and window-closing behavior models. These were developed using data from KTH Live-In Lab Apartments 2, 3, and 4 across different time periods (2020–2024).

The data supports modeling and simulation of occupant behavior in relation to indoor environmental conditions and window usage.
